# SQL-Project-Public
The public version of the SQL project
This project integrates Python, Powershell and SQL to execute an automated database generation - a database with weather information growing with 120 rows / day. This is achieved using API calls to a free site - openweathermap.org, then transferring files from Linux to Windows and finally a Powershell script that writes the info to SQL server. All this is fully automated.
